    "\n",
    "In \"Multi-Label\" classification, documents can be assigned multiple labels. This means that a document may have several appropriate tags or categories associated with it. For instance, consider a system that suggests tags for documents where multiple tags may be relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, \"Multi-Class\" classification applies when each document is assigned only one category. If there are only two possible categories, it is known as \"Binary\" classification. If there are more than two categories, it is referred to as \"Multi-Class\" classification. In this scenario, each document is assigned to a single category, without the possibility of multiple labels.\n",
